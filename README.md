# CinemaProject 
This is a program that checks whether a user is old enough to watch a film and whether there are enough seats left. 
The system also updates itself when somebody buys a film ticket and reduces the number of seats by one when someone purchases a ticket.
For simplicity, I used only four movies: 
Finding Dory: (minimum age to watch = 3, no. of available seats = 5)
Bourne: (minimum age to watch = 18, no. of available seats = 5)
Tarzan: (minimum age to watch = 15, no. of available seats = 5)
Ghost Busters: (minimum age to watch = 12, no. of available seats = 5).
